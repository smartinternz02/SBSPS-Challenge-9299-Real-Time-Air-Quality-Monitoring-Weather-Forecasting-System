Hi this is pradeep team member of CODE MAFIA.

MY ISSUES:

I am having an issue to claim the remaining badges.
I can't access the modules i.e. the pages are note loading and this is the I can't write my exam.
Recording the REDHAT they are showing error while we are accessing the course.

  And we have contacted to the support team and there is no response from their side.
